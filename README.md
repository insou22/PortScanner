# PortScanner
A Java program to scan the Internet to your hearts content.



# How to use

1. Download from the releases page.
2. Upload to your server (DO NOT RUN THIS ON YOUR HOME COMPUTER).
 -> Not because I'm encouraging you to be a skid, because this can get rather intensive if you do not have certain requirements. 
 -> If you don't have a server, pick one up from [Vultr](http://www.vultr.com/?ref=6914293-3B) and get $20 free credit (4 months of hosting on the lowest package)!.
3. Make sure you have Java installed on said server. **This program requires Java 8. Use it. It wont harm you.**
4. Run `java -jar PortScanner.jar`
 - This will initalize the program, and begin to ask you for desired port range to scan.
 - Looking to scan only one IP address? That's fine. Just use <DESIRED-IP-ADDRESS-/32.
 - This program works of CIDR's, and if you input an incorrect one, it'll let you know. For more info on CIDR's, check out here; http://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr
 
 
 
# Advanced usage.

1. Obviously, I couldn't leave out my Minecraft related friends, so there is an option to scan for MC servers too.
 - Just append `--mcscan` to the command usage, like shown above.
 
2. And for those who like to live dangerously. This program currently uses the first 8 threads available, if this isn't good enough for you, that's fine.
 - There is an option called `--superbeefymachine`, that will use a cached thread pool. **This will use every thread available. And I only advise you use this on clean servers**
 - This will max your CPU, however will reduce the speeds significantly. (I scanned a /24 in less than a second if I remember correctly).

I don't set a lot of terms, other than:
 - Don't abuse this. Don't use it for illegal stuff. I made this for fun, and I'm beginning to post more on GitHub. Don't abuse it.
 - I am not responsible for anything you do, or break with this application. You accept all responsibility for the application when you download it.
 - If your ISP (or server's ISP) hates you over this, again, not my fault. All responsibility lies on you.
 - You are _not permitted under any circumstances to sell this application_. Makes me sad :C
